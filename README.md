## Introduction

LeetCode is a popular platform for coding interviews and competitive programming. By solving these problems, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills and understanding of various algorithms and data structures. This repository contains my solutions to the problems I've tackled on LeetCode.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
leetcode_training/
│
├── Easy/
│ ├── problem_name/
│ │ ├── name.cpp
│ │ └── ...
│ └── ...
│
├── Medium/
│ ├── problem_name/
│ │ ├── name.cpp
│ │ └── ...
│ └── ...
│
├── Hard/
│ ├── problem_name/
│ │ ├── name.cpp
│ │ └── ...
│ └── ...
│
└── README.md
```

Each difficulty level (`Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`) has its own directory. Inside each directory, there are subdirectories for each problem, which include the solution code.
